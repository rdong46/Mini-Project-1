          "Spider-Man is a superhero appearing in American comic books published
          by Marvel Comics. Created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Steve
          Ditko, he first appeared in the anthology comic book Amazing Fantasy
          #15 (August 1962) in the Silver Age of Comic Books. He has since been
          featured in films, television shows, video games, and plays.
          Spider-Man is the alias of Peter Parker, an orphan raised by his Aunt
          May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary
          Parker died in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko had the character deal
          with the struggles of adolescence and financial issues and gave him
          many supporting characters, such as Flash Thompson, J. Jonah Jameson,
          and Harry Osborn; romantic interests Gwen Stacy, Mary Jane Watson, and
          the Black Cat; and foes such as Doctor Octopus, the Green Goblin, and
          Venom. In his origin story, he gets spider-related abilities from a
          bite from a radioactive spider; these include clinging to surfaces,
          superhuman strength and agility, and detecting danger with his
          "spider-sense." He also builds wrist-mounted "web-shooter" devices
          that shoot artificial spider webs of his own design.

          When Spider-Man first appeared in the early 1960s, teenagers in
          superhero comic books were usually relegated to the role of sidekick
          to the protagonist. The Spider-Man series broke ground by featuring
          Peter Parker, a high school student from Queens, New York, as
          Spider-Man's secret identity, whose "self-obsessions with rejection,
          inadequacy, and loneliness" were issues to which young readers could
          relate.[8] While Spider-Man had all the makings of a sidekick, unlike
          previous teen heroes such as Bucky and Robin, Spider-Man had no
          superhero mentor like Captain America and Batman; he thus had to learn
          for himself that "with great power there must also come great
          responsibility"—a line included in a text box in the final panel of
          the first Spider-Man story but later retroactively attributed to his
          guardian, his late Uncle Ben Parker.

          Marvel has featured Spider-Man in several comic book series, the first
          and longest-lasting of which is The Amazing Spider-Man. Over the
          years, the Peter Parker character developed from a shy, nerdy New York
          City high school student to troubled but outgoing college student, to
          married high school teacher to, in the late 2000s, a single freelance
          photographer. In the 2000s, he joins the Avengers. Doctor Octopus also
          took on the identity for a story arc spanning 2012–2014, following a
          body swap plot in which Peter appears to die.[9] Marvel has also
          published books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including
          Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the
          Spider-Man of the future; Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the
          adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in an alternate universe; and
          Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, which depicts the teenager Miles Morales,
          who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's
          supposed death. Miles later became a popular superhero in his own
          right, and was brought into the mainstream continuity, where he
          sometimes works alongside Peter.

          (2023). Reeve Carney starred originally as Spider-Man in the 2010
          Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.[13] Spider-Man has

          often ranked as one of the most popular and iconic comic book
          characters of all time and one of the most popular characters in all
